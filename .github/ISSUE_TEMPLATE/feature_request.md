**Preflight checklist**
- [ ] I have searched the existing issues and believe this will not be a duplicate of any existing issue.
- [ ] I understand that if this issue is about support for non-Elgato or non-Tacto hardware, it will be closed without explanation, as per issue #38.
- [ ] I understand that requests for the creation of new plugins or implementation of new actions should be opened as Discussions, not Issues.
- [ ] I reasonably believe that the time required to implement this feature is proportional to the value it will provide to users.
